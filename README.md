# Module 6 Challenge

### Background/Objectives
We had previously helped Jack, and he loved the PlanMyTrip App that we built for him. They recommended to add a few changes, mainly including weather description data.

For this, we will incorporate the weather description data into the PlanMyTrip App. We will have the Beta testers enter data that is within their criteria, and filter for locations that match this data. Fromhere we will be able to idetify potential travel destiantions, as well as nearby hotels. The Beta Tester will then choose 4 cities that are near each other, and using the Geoapify Routing API, will create the optimal travel route for the four cities.
